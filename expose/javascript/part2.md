1. 3, beacuse the length of the array is 3, so i stop at 3 and i is var type.
2. . 150, beacuse the prices[3]=300, and 300 *(1-0.5) is 150, and discontedPrice is var type is function scope.
3. 150, beacuse the finalPrice is the last discountedPrice *100/100, which are 150
4.  a list of 3 element [50,100,150] the for loop take each element of prices and  multiple by 0.5, then push the result to dicounted 
5. an error, the scope of variable i is inside the for loop because  it is a let type.
6. an error, the scope of variable discountedPrice is inside the for loop because it is a let type and declared inside the loop.
7. the value of finalPrices would print in console, because the finalPrices's scope is inside the function.
8. the discounted list would be returned, the scope of discounted is the discountprice function so the value of dicounted list would be returned.
9. an error, the scope of variable i is inside the for loop because  it is a let type.
10. 3, because lines 12 is inside the function scope and the scope of varibale length is the function.
11. a list of 3 element [50,100,150], discounted list is const type and we only push const type inside.
12. A. student.name
    B. student['Grad Year']
    C. student.greeting()
    D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
    E. student.courseLoad[0]
13. A.'32'  integers map to their exact string representation
    B. 1    string map to their integers representation
    C. 3    null is nothing got map to integers 0 because 3 is integers
    D. '3null'  null got map to their exact string representation
    E. 2    true maps to 1
    F. 0    alse and null map to 0 and
    G. '3undefined'     undefinded got map to their exact string representation
    H. NaN  undefined's Numeric Conversion is NaN.
14. A.ture  '2' got map to integers representation
    B.false because '1' is less then '2' strings are compared character-by-character
    C.true '2' got covert to 2
    D.error === would checks the equality without type conversion
    E.false true maps to 1 and 1 != 2
    F.true 2's Boolean Conversion is true
15. A strict equality operator === checks the equality without type conversion.
    A non-strict equality operator == checks the equality with type conversion.
17. the result would be [1,4,6] the for call the function callbcak which are dosomething, this function take in a value and multiple by 2
    and the result got push to a new arrays.
